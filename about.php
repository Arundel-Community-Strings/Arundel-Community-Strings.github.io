  <h2>Chris Gosper - Music Director</h2>
    <p>In September of 2017, Jennifer Danko asked Chris if she would be interested in conducting a string 
      orchestra for adults and students who were beginning to take private lessons but never had the opportunity 
      to play in an orchestra or with others, Chris was delighted.  It had been a dream of hers for years.  
      Playing alone in your practice room is rewarding, but playing with others is fun and fellowship.  
      Jennifer organized Arundel Community Strings and that dream has come true.</p>
    <p>Chris is the founder and Music Director of the Summer String Orchestra.  She is by nature a violist. 
      She began playing viola in the fifth grade and fell in love with it. From fall to spring she plays with 
      the Columbia Orchestra, Londontowne Symphony, is a substitute for Anne Arundel Community College Orchestra 
      and has played for Mid-Atlantic Symphony.  Chris is a private viola and violin instructor. She has been 
      guest conductor for the Allegany County All-County Orchestra Festival, is an adjudicator for Howard County 
      Solo and Ensembles, and has coached the Chesapeake Youth Orchestra String Quartet. Chris is the past 
      Music Director for Chamber Orchestra of Southern Maryland (COSMIC) and Southern Maryland Sinfonia, 
      Beginning Strings, Intermediate Orchestra, and Mentoring Orchestra. In her spare time she paints 
      Adirondack chairs and Baltimore style window screens or anything that doesn't move out of her way fast 
      enough. Her newest media is painting ceramic tiles with alcohol ink.</p>

    <h2>Jennifer Danko - Founder</h2>
    <p>Jennifer Danko, a resident of Glen Burnie and local preschool teacher, has played violin throughout her 
      school career.  Once she graduated college, she slid her violin under her bed, only to pull it back out 
      almost 20 years later when her youngest child began to play violin.  She greatly missed the energy of 
      playing with a group and when she looked for an orchestra to join, she discovered that there were plenty 
      of professional and semi-professional groups, but she found herself intimidated by the thought of an audition.</p> 
    <p>What she did find in her search were plenty of community <span style="font-style: italic;"> bands</span> that did not require an audition.  
      Why not create a community string <span style="font-style: italic;">orchestra</span> instead?  Her search for a director led her to Chris Gosper, 
      a local Director and Musician and things blossomed from there.  The two brainstormed and agreed to create 
      Arundel Community Strings, an orchestra that did not require an audition and gave
      adults (who read music well) an outlet to play music together for the joy of it!  She hopes to see 
      the group grow and gain popularity with all budding musicians as well as experienced 
      musicians who want to mentor lesser experienced string players in the great Spirit of Community!</p>

  <h2>Ayris Narock - Technical Support</h2>
    <p>Ayris Narock, a scientific software developer by day, had wanted to play a stringed instrument since she was a 
      child.   She was able to explore other musical interests along the way but it wasn't until the summer of 2017 
      (well into adulthood) that she finally began her journey learning viola.  When her teacher Chris suggested she 
      join the newly forming strings orchestra, Ayris was excited about the opportunity but skeptical that she was 
      really ready for such a thing.  She did end up joining, and it has turned into one of her great joys in life.  
      She now acts as the technical support lead for the group, managing the website and working with Jen on 
      communications and registration.  The friendships and musical camaraderie she has made in ACS extend well beyond 
      the Friday night rehearsals and her gratitude to Chris and Jen for making this possible cannot be overstated.</p>
